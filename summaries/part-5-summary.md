# Part 5: Chapter 1 Continuation - Rule #1 and The Brutal Reality

## Executive Summary

Part 5 delivers the most important reality check in the entire book: **Day trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme**. Andrew presents devastating statistics from Massachusetts court-ordered broker records showing that after 6 months of trading, only 16% of day traders made money. This means **84% were losing money**—and this is the optimistic view, as it doesn't count those who quit before 6 months.

Andrew introduces his **Rule #1: Day trading is not a strategy to get rich quickly** and backs it with a powerful testimonial from Kem, a 20-year veteran trader who needed to adapt to HFT-dominated markets. Even experienced traders must evolve or die. The message is clear: if you think "buy low, sell high" is simple, or if you expect to make money in days or weeks, stop reading and go on vacation instead—you'll have a better time and lose less money.

The timeline to profitability is brutal: Andrew's best students make consistent money before 6 months, but average is 6-8 months, and some take a year or more. Anyone promising "day one" or "one week" profits is lying. The chapter emphasizes that simulator trading is essential—one day in simulation is worth weeks of real trading because you can take more trades, make more mistakes, and learn faster without destroying your capital.

As a Senior Trader with 15+ years experience, I can confirm every word. The 84% failure rate is conservative—my estimate is 90-95% fail within the first year. The timeline Andrew gives (6-8 months average) assumes you're doing everything right: using a simulator, following risk rules, journaling, and learning from a community. Most people don't do this, so their timeline extends indefinitely until they quit.

## Key Concepts Covered

### The Brutal Statistics
- **16% profitable after 6 months** (Massachusetts broker data)
- **84% losing money** after 6 months
- **6-8 months average** to consistent profitability (Andrew's community, with mentorship)
- **6 months minimum** for better traders
- **1+ years** for slower learners
- **Many will fail** during the "fatal day trading learning curve"

### Rule #1 Introduction
- **Day trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme**
- Stay 3,000 feet away from anyone who thinks it is (social distancing for wealth protection)
- If you want quick/easy money, stop reading and go on vacation instead
- Day trading attracts "the most impulsive and gambling prone people"

### The Kem Testimonial (20-Year Veteran)
- Experienced trader with 20+ years had to adapt to HFT markets
- Previously traded same basket of stocks daily (old school method)
- Resisted scanning for "stocks in play" and trading unknown stocks
- Needed Andrew's "beginner" book to learn modern methods
- Praised methodical/mechanical approach
- Emphasized risk management and emotional control

### Common Misconceptions Debunked
- **"Buy low, sell high" is simple** - NO, if it were, everyone would succeed
- **"Buy the dip, sell the rally"** - Sounds easy, but isn't
- **Day trading looks deceptively easy** - This is the trap
- **Reading 1-2 books makes you profitable** - NO, requires practice, tools, ongoing education

### The Learning Curve
- **"Brutal learning curve"** - Andrew's exact words
- **"Fatal" for many** - Will destroy accounts and quit
- **Cannot be eliminated** - Only accelerated
- **Simulator trading accelerates learning exponentially** - One day simulation = weeks of real trading
- **Concentration and discipline required** - Highest levels

### Intermediate Trader Guidance
- Can skip to Chapter 7 for strategies
- But should skim earlier chapters
- Strategies in Chapter 7 have worked for "more than a decade"
- **"Success in trading is not a revolution, it is an evolution"** - Adapt existing strategies to personality and conditions
- Must adapt to changing markets (HFT, algorithms, technological/social changes)

### Book Structure Philosophy
- Glossary included for easy reference
- Beginner-friendly language
- Short and practical (respect for reader's time)
- Chapter 10 covers "real actionable steps" to enter day trading

## Detailed Breakdown

### The 16% Statistic: What It Really Means

Andrew cites Massachusetts court-ordered broker data showing **only 16% of day traders made money after 6 months.**

**Let's unpack this devastating statistic:**

**1. This is AFTER 6 months:**
- Not day one, not week one, not month one
- These traders survived half a year
- Many more quit before 6 months (not counted in this 84% failure rate)
- So the real failure rate is likely 90-95%+

**2. "Made money" is vague:**
- Does this mean net positive for the 6-month period?
- Or just profitable in month 6?
- Or any single profitable day?
- The loosest definition makes the stat look better than reality

**3. Doesn't account for:**
- Opportunity cost (could have made more working a job)
- Time invested (hundreds of hours)
- Emotional toll (stress, lost sleep, relationships strained)
- Those who quit before 6 months (survivorship bias)

**4. Massachusetts data is from traditional brokers:**
- This predates Robinhood and commission-free trading
- Modern failure rates are likely WORSE because:
  - Easier access means less serious participants
  - Gamification encourages overtrading
  - Social media creates FOMO and meme stock chasing
  - Zero commissions remove friction that used to slow impulsive trades

**The Real Math:**

If 100 people start day trading:
- **After 1 month**: 30-40 quit (lost too much or got scared)
- **After 3 months**: Another 20-30 quit (realized it's harder than expected)
- **After 6 months**: Of the 40-50 remaining, only 16% (6-8 people) are profitable
- **After 1 year**: Maybe 3-5 of the original 100 are consistently profitable
- **After 3 years**: 1-2 are still trading and profitable

**This is the reality Andrew is preparing you for.**

### Rule #1: Day Trading Is Not a Get-Rich-Quick Scheme

Andrew makes this his first official rule, and for good reason—this misconception kills more accounts than any technical mistake.

**The Social Distancing Graphic (Figure 1.4):**

Andrew's humor here carries a serious message:
- **COVID-19**: Stay 6 feet away (protect health)
- **Get-rich-quick promoters**: Stay 3,000 feet away (protect wealth)

The visual is brilliant because it uses pandemic context (fresh in 2020) to make the warning memorable.

**Who to Avoid:**

**Red Flags of Get-Rich-Quick Scammers:**
- Promise specific returns ("$500/day guaranteed")
- Show only winning trades
- Use luxury cars/watches/mansions in marketing
- Claim "secret strategy the pros don't want you to know"
- High-pressure sales tactics ("Only 5 spots left!")
- No verifiable track record
- Course costs $5,000+ with no trial or refund

**In 2025, this includes:**
- Instagram traders posing with rented Lamborghinis
- TikTok "day trader millionaires" (often selling courses, not trading)
- Discord "signal services" (front-running retail orders)
- YouTube ads promising "financial freedom in 30 days"
- Courses teaching options strategies to beginners (extremely dangerous)

**Andrew's Harsh Recommendation:**

If you think day trading is a quick/easy path to riches:
**"You should stop reading this book right now and spend the savings that you put aside for day trading on a nice family vacation. It would be much more satisfying to spend your money that way, rather than losing it in the stock market."**

This is not hyperbole. He genuinely means: if your mindset is wrong, you WILL lose your money, so spend it on something enjoyable instead.

**Why Get-Rich-Quick Thinking Destroys Traders:**

1. **Overleveraging**: Taking positions too large because "I need to make $1,000 today"
2. **Revenge trading**: Trying to "get even" after losses
3. **Ignoring risk management**: "I can't risk small, I need big wins fast"
4. **Strategy hopping**: Switching systems every week looking for the "magic bullet"
5. **Overtrading**: Taking marginal setups because "I need more opportunities"
6. **Quitting day job prematurely**: No income cushion creates desperation
7. **Emotional decisions**: Fear and greed dominate because every trade "matters too much"

**The Correct Mindset:**

- Trading is a skill-based profession requiring years to master
- Your goal for year one is education, not income
- Profits come AFTER you've built skill, discipline, and emotional control
- Think in terms of 2-3 year timeline to consistent profitability
- Treat losses as tuition, not failure
- Measure success by process adherence, not daily P&L

### The Kem Testimonial: Even 20-Year Veterans Must Adapt

Andrew includes a powerful Amazon review from Kem, a 20-year veteran trader. This is brilliant positioning because:

**Why This Testimonial Matters:**

1. **Credibility**: 20 years of experience validates she knows what she's talking about
2. **Humility**: Despite two decades, she's "not too proud" to read a beginner book
3. **Market evolution**: HFT changed the game; old methods stopped working
4. **Continuous learning**: Even experts must adapt or become obsolete
5. **Specific challenge**: She traded the same stocks daily, now needs to scan for "stocks in play"

**Kem's Specific Quotes:**

**"With the coming of HFT and other changes, it has been necessary to adjust my methodology."**

This is the evolution vs. revolution principle. Markets change:
- 1990s: Floor trading, human market makers
- 2000s: Electronic trading, decimalization
- 2010s: HFT dominance, algorithmic trading
- 2020s: Retail coordination (meme stocks), AI algorithms, zero commissions

Each decade requires adaptation.

**"Scanning for stocks in play and trading unknown stocks is an approach I have resisted for my entire career but I think I have to go there now."**

This reveals old-school methodology:
- Trade the same 10-20 stocks every day
- Learn their personalities and typical patterns
- Become an expert in a small universe

Modern approach:
- Scan for stocks with catalysts (news, earnings, unusual volume)
- Trade whatever is "in play" that day
- Requires adaptability, not deep stock-specific knowledge

**Both work, but markets have shifted toward the modern approach** because:
- More stocks available (thousands vs. hundreds)
- More catalysts daily (24/7 news cycle)
- Volatility concentrates in different names daily
- Algorithms exploit predictable patterns in frequently-traded names

**"I won't do it without a solid method/plan and a hard set of rules."**

This is the professional approach. She's not going to "wing it" or "feel her way through." She needs:
- Systematic rules for what makes a stock "in play"
- Entry and exit criteria
- Risk management parameters
- Execution plan

**"This book is exceptional. It gave me what I wanted and I will build on the information using what I already know."**

She's not blindly following Andrew's methods. She's:
- Taking the framework
- Adapting it with her 20 years of experience
- Creating a hybrid approach

This is exactly what advanced traders should do.

**"The author is an engineer and being of a methodical/mechanical mindset myself, I was happy with the way he laid it all out."**

Andrew's engineering background shows in:
- Systematic approach
- Clear rules and frameworks
- Logical progression
- Emphasis on data and journaling

This appeals to analytical minds but might frustrate intuitive traders (who can still succeed with adaptation).

**"There is also good information on other topics for real beginners such as the importance of risk management, emotional control which are important."**

Even with 20 years experience, she acknowledges risk management and emotional control are important—they never stop being important. These aren't "beginner topics you graduate from," they're foundational forever.

**The Lesson for You:**

If a 20-year veteran needs to adapt and isn't "too proud" to read a beginner book, what does that say about your willingness to learn?

- Never assume you've "arrived"
- Markets evolve; you must too
- Continuous education is not optional
- Humility is a competitive advantage
- Experience doesn't guarantee future success without adaptation

### The Timeline to Profitability: Managing Expectations

Andrew provides crucial timeline data from his community:

**"I have found that most of the better traders in our community consistently make money before the end of their sixth month. But for others it can take a year. On average, it usually takes from six to eight months."**

**Let's break this down carefully:**

**1. "Most of the better traders" = 6 months**
- Note: "BETTER traders" (top performers)
- Not average traders
- Not all traders
- The talented, dedicated, disciplined minority

**2. "Others" = 1 year**
- Still successful, just slower
- Probably more average talent or less time commitment
- But still succeeded (part of the 16% who make it)

**3. "On average" = 6-8 months**
- This is WITH Andrew's mentorship
- WITH Bear Bull Traders community support
- WITH proper tools and education
- WITH simulator training first
- WITH risk management rules

**4. "Consistently make money"**
- Not "had one profitable trade"
- Not "had one profitable day"
- Not "had one profitable week"
- CONSISTENT profitability

**What This Timeline Assumes:**

To hit the 6-8 month average, you must:
- Trade in simulator for 2-3 months first (not counted in the 6-8 months)
- Study daily (1-2 hours beyond trading time)
- Journal every trade
- Follow strict risk management (1-2% account risk per trade)
- Have adequate capital ($5,000-$25,000 minimum)
- Trade during optimal hours (first 1-2 hours of market)
- Be part of a community for feedback
- Watch experienced traders' live streams/videos
- Review your trades weekly with mentor or peer
- Have no major life disruptions (job stress, family crisis, etc.)

**If any of these are missing, add 3-6 months to timeline.**

**The Realistic Timeline for Most People:**

- **Months 1-3**: Simulation trading, learning platform, blown demo accounts, emotional rollercoaster
- **Months 4-6**: Transition to real money with tiny size, more blown demo accounts, occasional real profitable days
- **Months 7-9**: Inconsistent real money results (winning weeks followed by losing weeks)
- **Months 10-12**: Starting to see patterns, more consistent but still fragile
- **Months 13-18**: Developing consistency, occasional profitable months
- **Months 19-24**: Consistent profitability, can increase size carefully
- **Year 3+**: Truly professional level, confident in process

**This assumes you don't quit, don't blow up your account, and continuously learn.**

### The Scam of "Day One" Profitability Claims

Andrew calls out the absurdity directly:

**"It always amuses me to see books and online educational courses that advertise teaching a simple strategy to make you money from 'day one' or after a week or even after just one month. I am always intrigued to meet people who actually believe in advertising and are willing to pay for those products."**

**Why "Day One" Profit Claims Are Impossible:**

**Day 1 Reality:**
- You don't know how to use the platform
- You don't understand order types
- You can't read Level 2 data
- You don't know what "in play" means
- You can't identify support/resistance
- You don't have hotkeys configured
- You're terrified to click the buy button
- If you do trade, it's random luck (50/50 win/loss)

**Week 1 Reality:**
- You've made a few trades (probably lost money)
- You're starting to understand the platform
- You've watched some videos
- You might have had a lucky winning day (this is dangerous—creates false confidence)
- You don't understand why trades work or don't work
- No pattern recognition yet

**Month 1 Reality:**
- You're less terrified but still confused
- You've probably lost money overall
- You've identified 1-2 strategies you like
- You're starting to see patterns (but can't execute consistently)
- Emotions are intense (fear dominates)

**Anyone claiming they can make you profitable in this timeline is either:**
1. Lying to sell a product
2. Showing cherry-picked examples
3. Defining "profitable" as "had one winning trade ever"
4. Running a scam

**How to Identify Scam Courses:**

Red flags:
- Promise specific dollar amounts or timeframes
- Use urgency tactics ("Only 3 spots left!")
- Show Lamborghinis and mansions
- "Secret system" or "special indicator"
- No refund policy or trial period
- Can't find independent reviews
- Course creator doesn't actually trade (only sells courses)
- Testimonials look fake (stock photos, generic names)

**Legitimate Education:**
- Provides realistic timelines (6-12+ months)
- Emphasizes risk and difficulty
- Offers money-back guarantee or trial
- Has independent reviews and social proof
- Educator actively trades (shares real P&L, not just cherry-picked wins)
- Community of actual successful students (not just testimonials)
- Focuses on process and education, not income promises

### Simulator Trading: The Secret Weapon

Andrew emphasizes: **"Trading in a simulator account is expediting your learning curve exponentially. One day of trading in a simulator can be worth weeks of training in real accounts or offline."**

**Why Simulation Is So Powerful:**

**1. Risk-Free Mistakes:**
- Blow up accounts without losing real money
- Test position sizes safely
- Experiment with strategies
- Learn what NOT to do

**2. Accelerated Volume:**
- Take 20 trades/day instead of 2-3
- Can trade aggressively to learn limits
- No emotional capital preservation (so you see what happens when you overtrade)

**3. Emotional Baseline:**
- Get comfortable with executions
- Learn platform mechanics
- Build pattern recognition database
- Develop muscle memory for hotkeys

**4. Strategy Testing:**
- Try multiple setups quickly
- Identify what resonates with your personality
- Refine entry/exit rules
- Test different timeframes

**However, Simulation Has Limits:**

**What It CAN'T Teach:**
- Real emotional pressure (fear and greed)
- How you react when it's YOUR money
- Slippage and real execution quality
- The temptation to revenge trade
- The euphoria of wins (and subsequent overconfidence)

**The Optimal Approach:**

**Phase 1: Simulation Only (2-3 months)**
- Goal: 60%+ win rate with 2:1 reward/risk minimum
- Track at least 100 trades
- Journal every single one
- Identify your top 3 setups
- Master platform and hotkeys

**Phase 2: Tiny Real Money (Months 3-6)**
- Start with $500-$1,000 account
- Trade 10-20 shares only (minimum size)
- Goal: NOT to make money, but to learn emotional management
- Compare execution quality to simulation
- Continue journaling obsessively

**Phase 3: Gradual Size Increase (Months 6-12)**
- If consistently profitable for 2+ months, increase size slightly
- Never increase more than 25% at a time
- If you have 2 losing weeks, drop back to previous size
- Risk management rules become non-negotiable

**Phase 4: Professional Trading (Year 2+)**
- Now trading meaningful size
- But still following strict rules
- Still journaling and reviewing
- Still learning and adapting

**Modern Simulation Platforms (2025):**
- **Thinkorswim** (best overall, realistic data)
- **TradeStation** (good for active traders)
- **Interactive Brokers** (realistic executions)
- **TradingView** (paper trading feature, good for learning)
- **Webull** (simple, mobile-friendly)

**Cost**: Most are free, some require small account deposit.

**Common Mistakes in Simulation:**

1. **Trading unrealistic size**: Sim trading 1,000 shares when you'll start with 10
2. **Ignoring risk management**: "It's fake money, who cares"—wrong mindset
3. **Not journaling**: Defeats the purpose of accelerated learning
4. **Quitting too early**: "I'm profitable in sim, time to go live!" after 2 weeks
5. **Not treating it seriously**: Taking trades you'd never take with real money

**The Rule**: **Treat simulation like real money.** Follow every rule you'll use live. If you can't be disciplined in simulation, you definitely won't be in live markets.

### "Success Is Not a Revolution, It Is an Evolution"

One of Andrew's best quotes:

**"Work on simple, well-known strategies, but adjust them over time to complement your own personality and whatever the current market conditions are. Success in trading is not a revolution, it is an evolution."**

**What This Means:**

**NOT a Revolution:**
- You won't discover a "secret" strategy no one knows
- You won't invent a revolutionary approach
- You don't need complicated custom indicators
- The "holy grail" doesn't exist

**IS an Evolution:**
- Take proven strategies (Support/Resistance, VWAP, Bull Flags)
- Test them in your personality and time availability
- Gradually refine entry/exit rules
- Adapt to changing market conditions
- Develop your own style over time

**The Chapter 7 Strategies:**

Andrew mentions the strategies in Chapter 7 "have been successfully used for more than a decade now."

This is important because it means:
- They're not fads
- They've survived multiple market regimes
- They're based on fundamentals of price action
- But you must adapt them to current conditions

**Examples of Evolution vs. Revolution:**

**Revolution (Doesn't Work):**
- "I invented a new indicator that predicts price perfectly!"
- "I found a pattern no one else knows about!"
- "I created an algorithm that beats the market!"

**Evolution (Works):**
- "I trade bull flags, but I added a volume filter that improves my win rate"
- "I use VWAP, but I only trade it between 9:45-10:30 AM when it works best for me"
- "I trade support/resistance, but I wait for a candlestick confirmation before entering"

**Adapting to Personality:**

Not all strategies fit all people:

| Strategy | Best For | Avoid If You're |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Scalping | Quick decisions, high focus | Slow processor, easily stressed |
| Trend following | Patient, disciplined | Impulsive, need constant action |
| Reversals | Contrarian, brave | Risk-averse, need confirmation |
| Momentum | Aggressive, confident | Conservative, doubt-prone |

**Try multiple strategies in simulation, then specialize in 1-2 that match your personality.**

### The Intermediate Trader Guidance

Andrew addresses experienced traders:

**"If you don't consider yourself a novice trader, then you may wish to jump ahead and start reading at Chapter 7 for an overview of these important day trading strategies. However, I encourage you to skim through the earlier chapters as well."**

**Why This Matters:**

1. **Acknowledges different audiences**: Not just beginners
2. **Provides flexibility**: Can skip to strategies if experienced
3. **Still recommends fundamentals**: "Skim through earlier chapters"

**My Recommendation for Intermediate Traders:**

Even if you have experience:
- **READ Chapter 3 (Risk and Account Management)**: No one has mastered this completely
- **READ Chapter 4 (How to Find Stocks)**: Scanning approach may differ from yours
- **SKIM Chapter 5 (Tools and Platforms)**: May discover better tools
- **SKIM Chapter 6 (Candlesticks)**: Probably know this, but review never hurts
- **READ Chapter 7 (Strategies)**: Even if you know them, Andrew's presentation may offer new insights
- **READ Chapter 8 (Step by Step)**: Process is everything
- **READ Chapter 9 (Case Study)**: Learn from others' journeys
- **READ Chapter 10 (Next Steps)**: Actionable advice for all levels

**Don't skip just because you have experience.** Kem had 20 years and still learned from a "beginner" book.

## How to Apply This in Real Trading

### Immediate Actions

1. **Reality check your expectations**
   - Write down: "I understand that 84% of traders lose money after 6 months"
   - Write down: "I expect this to take 6-12 months minimum to see consistent profitability"
   - Write down: "I will not expect profits in days or weeks"
   - Sign and date it. Read it when you get frustrated.

2. **Assess your mindset honestly**
   - Why do you want to day trade?
   - If answer is "quick money" or "easy money," STOP and reconsider
   - If answer is "I'm fascinated by markets" or "I want a skill-based profession," continue

3. **Set up simulation trading TODAY**
   - Download Thinkorswim or your preferred platform
   - Create paper trading account
   - Commit to 2-3 months before touching real money
   - Set calendar reminder to review progress monthly

4. **Create a learning timeline**
   - Months 1-3: Simulation only, zero real money
   - Months 4-6: Tiny real money ($500-1K account), continue simulation in parallel
   - Months 7-12: Gradual size increase IF consistent profitability
   - Year 2+: Professional approach

5. **Identify and avoid get-rich-quick scams**
   - Unfollow Instagram "traders" with Lamborghinis
   - Ignore YouTube ads promising "financial freedom in 30 days"
   - Avoid Discord signal services
   - Be skeptical of anyone promising specific returns

### Integration with Previous Lessons

**Connecting to Part 1 (Disclaimer):**
- The 84% failure rate validates the "very high risk" warning
- "No guarantees" is proven by Massachusetts broker data
- This chapter shows WHY most traders fail (wrong expectations)

**Connecting to Part 2 (Table of Contents):**
- Chapter 7 strategies mentioned again—they're proven over a decade
- Chapter 10 "real actionable steps" referenced
- Confirms the logical structure of the book

**Connecting to Part 3 (Foreword - Community):**
- Kem's success required adaptation—validates continuous learning
- Bear Bull Traders community helps reduce the 6-8 month timeline
- The 84% who fail are likely those trading alone

**Connecting to Part 4 (2020 Hindsight):**
- Crisis traders (COVID-driven) probably have WORSE than 84% failure rate
- The timeline (6-8 months) assumes you're not starting during maximum volatility
- Record-keeping and simulation are how you beat the statistics

**New Understanding:**
- The book isn't just education—it's a filter to scare away get-rich-quick seekers
- Andrew is deliberately harsh to set proper expectations
- Those who continue after reading this chapter have the right mindset
- The strategies work (decade+ track record) but require time to master

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Skipping simulation to "start making money faster"**
   - You'll lose money faster, not make it faster
   - Simulation accelerates learning exponentially
   - Those who skip it typically blow up accounts and quit

2. **Believing "day one" profit promises**
   - Any course promising this is a scam
   - You'll waste money on the course AND lose money trading
   - Legitimate education never promises specific timeframes

3. **Comparing yourself to outliers**
   - Someone posts "$5,000 profit my first week!" on Reddit
   - They're either lying, got lucky (unsustainable), or are the 1% exception
   - You're competing against your past self, not others

4. **Quitting too early because "it's taking too long"**
   - After 2 months: "I'm not profitable yet, this doesn't work"
   - Wrong—Andrew said 6-8 months AVERAGE
   - Quitting at 2 months means you wasted 2 months instead of investing 6-8

5. **Not adapting to market changes**
   - "This strategy worked last month, why doesn't it work now?"
   - Markets evolve (like Kem's experience with HFT)
   - Rigid traders die; flexible traders survive

6. **Assuming experience = guaranteed success**
   - "I have 5 years in investing, day trading will be easy"
   - Wrong—day trading is completely different from long-term investing
   - Kem had 20 years and still needed to adapt to modern markets

7. **Trading without a community**
   - Trying to figure it out alone
   - Reinforcing bad habits without feedback
   - Missing insights from others' experiences
   - Part of why 84% fail—they're isolated

## Senior Trader's Perspective

### What Actually Works in Live Markets

**The 16% Statistic Is Conservative:**

In my experience:
- **Month 1**: 60-70% quit or blow up
- **Month 3**: 80% gone
- **Month 6**: 85-90% gone (Andrew's 84% failure rate confirmed)
- **Month 12**: 92-95% gone
- **Year 3**: 97-98% gone
- **Year 5+**: ~2-3% remain and are profitable

**The Massachusetts data shows 16% profitable after 6 months.** But this doesn't track:
- How many of that 16% are still profitable at month 12? (probably half)
- How many at year 2? (probably 25% of the original 16%, so 4% overall)
- How many make it a career? (maybe 1-2% of original entrants)

**The Timeline Andrew Gives Is Optimistic:**

He says 6-8 months average for his community. This is TRUE but has context:

**These traders have:**
- His mentorship directly
- Bear Bull Traders community (1,200+ very active members)
- Proven strategies taught systematically
- Daily chat room with live trade ideas and feedback
- Video library of hundreds of setups
- Accountability and support

**If you're NOT in a community like this:**
- Add 6-12 months to timeline
- Failure rate increases from 84% to 90-95%
- Many more false starts and blown accounts

**This is why I emphasize community in every summary.** It's not optional—it's the difference between 84% failure and 95% failure.

**The "Day One" Scams:**

I've seen these evolve over 15 years:

**2010-2015**: DVD courses claiming "trade for 10 minutes a day, make $500"
**2015-2020**: Webinars claiming "my secret indicator, $1997 one-time payment"
**2020-2025**: Instagram/TikTok "traders" with rented Lamborghinis selling Discord signals

**They all have the same promise**: Quick, easy money with minimal effort.

**They all have the same result**: Students lose money trading AND waste money on the course.

**How to spot them**:
1. Income claims ("I make $10,000/day")
2. Lifestyle porn (cars, watches, mansions)
3. "Secret" or "exclusive" methods
4. High pressure (limited time/spots)
5. No refund policy
6. Can't verify track record

**Legitimate educators (like Andrew)**:
1. Emphasize difficulty and time required
2. Show realistic results and losses
3. Provide data and evidence
4. Offer refunds or trials
5. Have public track records
6. Build long-term communities

**Simulation Is Non-Negotiable:**

In 15 years, I've never met a successful trader who didn't spend significant time in simulation.

**Those who skip it**:
- Lose money faster
- Blow up accounts repeatedly
- Develop bad habits (revenge trading, overleveraging)
- Quit in frustration

**Those who embrace it**:
- Learn faster (more trades, more mistakes safely)
- Build pattern recognition
- Develop emotional baseline
- Enter live trading with confidence

**My rule**: 100 trades in simulation with 60%+ win rate and 2:1 reward/risk MINIMUM before going live.

Most skip this. Most fail.

### Modern Context (2025)

This chapter was written in 2020. How does it hold up 5 years later?

**What's More Relevant Now:**

1. **The get-rich-quick problem is WORSE**
   - TikTok and Instagram full of fake traders
   - Robinhood made entry trivially easy
   - Meme stocks (GameStop, AMC) created lottery mentality
   - "Financial freedom" courses everywhere

2. **The 84% failure rate is probably higher**
   - Commission-free trading removed friction
   - Easier access = less serious participants
   - Social media FOMO drives impulsive trades
   - 24/7 crypto trading creates overtrading

3. **HFT is even more dominant**
   - Kem's concern in 2016 has intensified
   - Algorithms now account for 70-80% of volume (vs. 60-70% in 2016)
   - Retail traders must adapt or die
   - Simple patterns get arbitraged faster

4. **Simulator trading is easier**
   - Better platforms (Thinkorswim improved)
   - More realistic data
   - Mobile simulation available
   - No excuse not to use it

**What's Changed Since 2020:**

1. **The GameStop/AMC phenomenon (2021)**
   - Retail coordination via Reddit
   - Massive influx of new traders
   - Most lost everything when bubble burst
   - Created unrealistic expectations (100%+ gains in days)

2. **0DTE options explosion**
   - Zero days to expiration options became massive
   - Extreme volatility in SPY/QQQ intraday
   - New opportunities but also new ways to blow up

3. **AI and ChatGPT**
   - AI-powered trading assistants emerging
   - Sentiment analysis tools
   - Doesn't change fundamentals, but adds complexity

4. **More competition**
   - Bear Bull Traders probably 10,000+ members now
   - More trading communities launched
   - More noise to filter through

**The Core Truth Remains:**

Despite all changes, **84% still fail (probably 90%+ now)** because:
- Human psychology hasn't changed
- Greed and fear still dominate
- Get-rich-quick thinking still destroys
- Discipline is still rare
- Continuous learning is still avoided

**The strategies in Chapter 7 still work** because they're based on:
- Supply and demand
- Support and resistance
- Volume and momentum
- Human psychology driving price action

These fundamentals don't change.

### Pro Tips & Advanced Insights

**The "3,000 Feet" Rule Extended:**

Andrew says stay 3,000 feet from get-rich-quick promoters. I extend this:

**Stay 3,000 feet from:**
1. Anyone promising specific dollar amounts
2. Anyone showing only winning trades
3. Anyone using fear/urgency tactics
4. Anyone claiming "secret" methods
5. Anyone without verifiable track record
6. Anyone who doesn't emphasize risk

**Stay 6 feet from:**
1. Traders who overtrade (shows lack of discipline)
2. Traders who don't journal (shows lack of professionalism)
3. Traders who blame the market (shows lack of accountability)
4. Traders who trade every single day (shows addiction, not strategy)
5. Traders who trade without a plan (shows gambling mentality)

**Surround yourself with:**
1. Traders who emphasize risk management
2. Traders who share losses openly
3. Traders who journal and review systematically
4. Traders who take days off
5. Traders who treat it as a business, not a hobby

**The Kem Lesson Applied:**

Kem adapted after 20 years. Ask yourself:

**"Am I flexible enough to adapt when my strategies stop working?"**

Most traders aren't. They:
- Blame the market ("It's rigged!")
- Blame algorithms ("HFT took my edge!")
- Blame brokers ("My fills are terrible!")
- Quit ("Day trading is impossible now!")

**Successful traders**:
- Recognize when edge diminishes
- Study new approaches
- Test adaptations in simulation
- Gradually implement changes
- Continue learning

**If you're rigid, you'll die like the dinosaurs.** Markets evolve; you must too.

**The 100-Trade Simulation Milestone:**

Before going live with real money, achieve this in simulation:

**Minimum Requirements:**
- 100 trades documented in journal
- 60%+ win rate
- 2:1 average reward/risk
- Maximum 3 consecutive losses before stopping
- Following position sizing rules consistently
- Can articulate WHY each trade was taken
- Can identify which strategy each trade represents

**If you hit this in simulation, you're ready for TINY real money.**

**If you can't hit this in simulation, you have ZERO business risking real capital.**

**The Timeline Manipulation:**

Andrew says 6-8 months for his community. You can manipulate this (good or bad):

**Accelerate Timeline (Reach 6 months faster):**
- Trade simulation 2+ hours daily
- Join community (Bear Bull Traders or similar)
- Watch live trading streams daily
- Journal obsessively
- Review trades with mentor weekly
- Read books (this one and others)
- Watch educational videos 1+ hour daily
- Take weekends to review and reflect

**Extend Timeline (Take longer than 8 months):**
- Trade without simulation
- Learn alone without community
- Skip journaling
- Ignore risk management
- Overtrade
- Revenge trade
- Don't review mistakes

**Most people unknowingly extend their timeline by skipping the accelerators.**

**The Massachusetts Data Deep Dive:**

The stat: "After 6 months, only 16% made money."

**Hidden questions:**
1. How much money? $1 or $10,000?
2. Net of commissions? (This was pre-commission-free era)
3. Accounting for time invested?
4. Before or after taxes?

**Even if you're in the 16%, you might:**
- Make $500 over 6 months
- Spend 500 hours (= $1/hour)
- Worse than minimum wage

**The real goal isn't "making money," it's "making enough money to justify the time and risk."**

This requires:
- 70%+ win rate OR
- 3:1+ reward/risk OR
- 10+ trades/day with consistent edge

**Most of the 16% "profitable" traders aren't making meaningful income.** Maybe 5% of that 16% (so 0.8% overall) are making career-level money.

**Sobering, but realistic.**

### Personal Opinion

**What's Excellent:**

1. **The 16% statistic is game-changing** - Most books hide this data. Andrew leads with it. This honesty filters out delusional readers.

2. **Rule #1 is perfect** - Making this the FIRST rule (not buried in chapter 10) shows priorities. If you don't accept this, you shouldn't continue.

3. **The Kem testimonial is brilliant** - Showing that even 20-year veterans need this book removes ego ("I'm too experienced for a beginner book").

4. **The social distancing graphic is memorable** - Humor makes the message stick. Everyone remembers "stay 3,000 feet away from get-rich-quick schemes."

5. **Timeline expectations are realistic** - 6-8 months with community/mentorship is honest. Not "3 days" or "3 years," but achievable with work.

6. **Simulation emphasis is correct** - "One day simulation = weeks of real training" is absolutely true. This could save readers thousands of dollars.

7. **The "success is evolution" quote is gold** - Encapsulates trading philosophy perfectly. No magic bullets, just gradual improvement.

**What Needs Adjustment:**

1. **The 16% may be outdated** - This is pre-Robinhood data. 2025 failure rates are likely worse (90%+). Andrew should emphasize this.

2. **The timeline assumes ideal conditions** - 6-8 months is WITH community, simulation, discipline, capital, time. Most people lack one or more. Should clarify.

3. **Missing the "how much money" context** - Being "profitable" at $500 over 6 months isn't the same as making $5,000/month. Needs definition.

4. **Could emphasize community more** - Mentions it briefly, but doesn't stress that solo traders take 2-3X longer (if they make it at all).

**What's Timeless:**

- The difficulty of trading (hasn't changed in 100 years)
- Human psychology (fear, greed, impatience)
- The need for practice and simulation
- The danger of get-rich-quick thinking
- The requirement to adapt to market changes

**My Recommendation:**

**Read this chapter multiple times:**
1. First read: To understand the statistics and timeline
2. Second read: After 1 month of simulation (to recalibrate expectations)
3. Third read: Before going live with real money (to ensure you're ready)
4. Fourth read: After first losing week (to regain perspective)

**This chapter is more important than Chapter 7 (strategies).** Because if your mindset isn't right, the best strategy in the world won't save you.

**If you read this chapter and think:**
- "84% fail? I'll be in the 16%!" → You're probably wrong, but at least you know the odds
- "84% fail? I should probably just invest in index funds." → This is the wise choice for most people
- "84% fail? I'll work harder than 84% of people." → Good, but hard work alone doesn't guarantee success—you need the right approach

**The readers who succeed are those who read this and think:**
"84% fail because they treat it like gambling, don't use simulation, have no community, and expect quick profits. I'll do the opposite: treat it professionally, simulate for months, join a community, and expect a multi-year learning curve."

**That mindset gives you a real chance at being in the 16%** (or more realistically, the 5% who make it long-term).

## Key Takeaways (TL;DR)

1. **Only 16% of day traders make money after 6 months** (84% lose) - Massachusetts broker data, probably worse now
2. **Rule #1: Day trading is not a get-rich-quick scheme** - Stay 3,000 feet from anyone who thinks it is
3. **Timeline to profitability: 6-8 months average** (with community/mentorship), but can take 1+ years
4. **Even 20-year veterans must adapt** - Kem's testimonial shows continuous learning is essential regardless of experience
5. **Simulation accelerates learning exponentially** - One day simulation = weeks of real trading practice
6. **"Day one" profitability claims are scams** - Legitimate education emphasizes time and difficulty
7. **Success is evolution, not revolution** - Adapt proven strategies to your personality and market conditions

## Action Items for Next Trading Session

- [ ] Write reality check statement: "I understand 84% of traders lose money. I expect 6-12 months minimum to consistent profitability."
- [ ] Set up paper trading account (Thinkorswim, TradeStation, or similar) and commit to 2-3 months before real money
- [ ] Create learning timeline with milestones: Month 3 (evaluation), Month 6 (consideration for tiny real money), Month 12 (size increase if profitable)
- [ ] Identify and unfollow/block get-rich-quick accounts on social media (Instagram traders with Lamborghinis, TikTok "millionaires," YouTube ad scams)
- [ ] Join a legitimate trading community (Bear Bull Traders, SMB Training, or verified alternative) - budget $150-300/month
- [ ] Set 100-trade simulation goal: Won't go live until achieving 60%+ win rate, 2:1 reward/risk, documented in journal
- [ ] Read Kem's review again and ask: "Am I humble enough to learn from a 'beginner' book even if I have experience?"
- [ ] Define "success" for yourself: How much monthly income justifies the time and risk? (Be realistic: $500/month isn't life-changing)

## Glossary

**16% Statistic**: Court-ordered Massachusetts broker data showing only 16% of day traders were profitable after 6 months (84% losing money). Conservative estimate; most academic studies show 90-97% failure rates.

**HFT (High Frequency Trading)**: Algorithmic trading systems that execute thousands of trades per second, accounting for 60-80% of daily market volume. Changed day trading landscape by reducing edge in simple patterns.

**Stocks in Play**: Securities with catalysts (news, earnings, unusual volume) creating tradeable price movement on a particular day. Modern approach scans daily for these vs. trading same basket every day.

**Simulation / Paper Trading**: Practice trading with fake money in real market conditions. Accelerates learning by allowing more trades, mistakes, and experimentation without financial loss.

**Learning Curve**: Time and effort required to develop trading competency. Andrew describes it as "brutal" and "fatal" for many traders. Typically 6-8 months minimum with community/mentorship.

**Get-Rich-Quick Scheme**: Unrealistic belief that day trading will generate substantial profits quickly and easily. Andrew's Rule #1 explicitly states trading is NOT this.

**Social Distancing (Trading Context)**: Andrew's humorous reference to COVID-19 guidelines, recommending staying 3,000 feet away from anyone promoting get-rich-quick trading schemes.

**Evolution vs. Revolution (Trading)**: Andrew's philosophy that success comes from gradually adapting proven strategies to your personality and market conditions (evolution), not discovering secret new methods (revolution).

**Basket of Stocks**: Old-school approach of trading the same 10-20 stocks daily to learn their patterns. Less effective in modern markets dominated by HFT; now replaced by scanning for "stocks in play."

**Consistent Profitability**: String of profitable weeks/months showing genuine edge, not just lucky wins. Andrew's timeline (6-8 months) refers to achieving this, not just "one profitable trade."

**Better Traders**: Andrew's term for top-performing students who reach profitability faster (before 6 months). Represents talented, disciplined minority, not average traders.

**Fatal Learning Curve**: Many traders "fail" and quit during the steep initial learning period, often after blowing up accounts. Emphasizes danger and difficulty of day trading.

**Methodical/Mechanical Mindset**: Kem's (20-year veteran) description of Andrew's engineering approach—systematic rules, frameworks, data-driven decisions vs. intuitive/emotional trading.

**Real Accounts vs. Offline**: Andrew's comparison of simulation to real money trading and studying without practice. Simulation offers accelerated learning (one day = weeks of other methods).

**Impulsive and Gambling Prone**: Andrew's description of many day trading entrants who treat markets like a casino rather than a professional skill requiring discipline.
