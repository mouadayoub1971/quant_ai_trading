# Part 4: Chapter 1 - Introduction & 2020 Hindsight

## Executive Summary

Chapter 1 begins with Andrew Aziz's "2020 Hindsight" section, explaining why he revised this bestselling book (published originally in 2015) during the COVID-19 pandemic. This isn't just background—it contains critical lessons about **why people get interested in trading at exactly the wrong time** and what that means for your journey.

The data Andrew presents is sobering: Google searches for "stock market" spiked dramatically in March-April 2020 as the market crashed. This pattern repeats in every major crash (2008 financial crisis, 2000 dot-com bubble). **People become interested in trading when markets are crashing and in the news, not during the boring bull markets when consistent money is actually easier to make.** This creates a dangerous dynamic: new traders enter during maximum volatility with minimum experience.

Andrew's personal story—trading from remote locations worldwide, climbing the Volcanic Seven Summits, forced to stay home during the pandemic—reveals something important about successful traders: they treat trading as a flexible profession that supports their lifestyle, not as a get-rich-quick scheme. He emphasizes record-keeping (comparing traders to doctors who document everything) and mentions he's mentored many now-successful traders whose stories will appear later in the book.

As a Senior Trader, I can tell you this chapter is **more important than it appears**. If you're reading this book because markets crashed and made the news, you're starting at a statistical disadvantage. Not because you can't succeed, but because your motivation and timing are driven by external hype rather than genuine interest in markets as a craft. Awareness of this bias is the first step to overcoming it.

## Detailed Breakdown

### The Dangerous Pattern: Crisis-Driven Trading Interest

Andrew's Google Trends chart (Figure 1.1) reveals a troubling pattern that repeats throughout history:

**The Correlation:**
- Markets crash → News coverage increases → Google searches spike → New traders enter

**Why This Is Dangerous:**

1. **Wrong motivation**: Entering because "everyone's talking about it" rather than genuine interest
2. **Maximum difficulty**: Starting during highest volatility when even pros struggle
3. **Emotional environment**: Fear and greed are amplified during crises
4. **Capital at risk**: New traders deploying precious capital at the worst possible time for learning
5. **Survivorship bias**: Only the exceptional survive starting during crises

**Historical Examples:**

**2000 Dot-Com Bubble:**
- Tech stocks soared to absurd valuations
- "Everyone" was day trading from home
- CNBC was on in every office
- Result: 95%+ of day traders lost money when bubble burst
- Many who started in the euphoria lost everything

**2008 Financial Crisis:**
- Market crashed 50%+ from peak
- News covered it 24/7
- New traders thought "I'll catch the bottom!"
- Result: False bottoms destroyed accounts, recovery took years
- Timing the bottom is nearly impossible even for professionals

**2020 COVID Crash:**
- Fastest crash in history (35% in weeks)
- Unprecedented volatility (circuit breakers triggered multiple times)
- Robinhood and commission-free trading made entry trivially easy
- Locked-down people at home with time and stimulus checks
- Result: Massive influx of novice traders into maximum-difficulty environment

**The Irony:**

The best time to learn trading is during **boring, low-volatility bull markets** when:
- Patterns are clearer and more consistent
- Risk is lower for beginners
- Emotions are more manageable
- Consistent strategies work predictably
- You can build skills without maximum pressure

But that's when no one cares about trading. They're busy with their jobs, not thinking about markets.

**If You're Starting Because of a Crisis:**

This doesn't mean you'll fail. But you need to:
1. **Acknowledge the bias**: You're starting for external reasons, not internal passion
2. **Extend your timeline**: Accept that learning during volatility takes longer
3. **Reduce position size**: Use even smaller capital than normal beginners
4. **Focus on process**: Ignore the hype, focus on skill development
5. **Accept small gains**: Don't try to replicate the $50,000 profit stories you see on Reddit

### The SPY Chart: Bull Market vs. Bear Market

Figure 1.2 shows the stark contrast between 2019's smooth uptrend and March 2020's violent crash.

**What the Chart Teaches:**

**2019 Bull Market (Left Side):**
- Steady, predictable uptrend
- Small pullbacks quickly bought
- Low volatility
- Easier environment for trend-following strategies
- **This is when you should be learning**, but no one cares because it's not in the news

**2020 Bear Market (Right Side):**
- Violent, unpredictable whipsaws
- Massive gap downs (overnight crashes)
- Extreme volatility
- False bottoms and bear market rallies
- **This is when everyone wants to start**, but it's the hardest environment

**Key Terms Introduced:**

**SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust):**
- Tracks the S&P 500 index (500 largest US companies)
- Most liquid ETF in the world
- Extremely important for day traders (indicates overall market direction)
- When SPY is green, most stocks trend up; when SPY is red, most stocks trend down
- Professional traders watch SPY constantly

**Bull Market:**
- Extended period of rising prices (months to years)
- Optimism dominates
- "Buy the dip" mentality works
- 2009-2020 was the longest bull market in history

**Bear Market:**
- Extended period of falling prices (decline of 20%+ from peak)
- Pessimism and fear dominate
- "Sell the rip" mentality emerges
- Much harder to make money (both directions are risky)

**The 2020 Crash Context:**

From peak to trough (Feb-March 2020):
- SPY: $340 → $220 (35% decline)
- Fastest crash in history (weeks, not months)
- Circuit breakers triggered multiple times (market halts when decline is too fast)
- VIX (volatility index) hit all-time highs
- Even experienced traders struggled

**If you started trading in March 2020, you started in the hardest market environment in over a decade.**

### Andrew's Questions from New Traders

The three questions Andrew received repeatedly reveal what beginners actually care about:

**1. "Are the tools and brokers you recommended still valid?"**

This reveals: Beginners focus on infrastructure (which is important) but often delay actual skill development by endlessly researching "the best broker."

**Reality Check**: The broker matters, but it's maybe 5% of your success equation. Discipline and strategy are 95%. Don't spend 3 months choosing a broker when you should be spending 3 months in simulation.

**2. "Have you changed strategies, or do they still work in volatile markets?"**

This reveals: Beginners think strategies "stop working" and need constant updating.

**Reality Check**: Core price action principles haven't changed in 100+ years. Support, resistance, volume, momentum—these work in all market conditions. What changes is *which* strategies work *best* in current conditions. A flexible trader has multiple tools and uses the right one for the environment.

**3. "What about commission-free apps like Robinhood?"**

This reveals: Beginners are attracted to "free" and easy access without understanding the trade-offs.

**Reality Check (2025 perspective)**: Robinhood and similar apps made trading accessible but also:
- Created gamification that encourages overtrading
- Simplified to the point of hiding important information (Level 2, advanced orders)
- Had execution quality issues (payment for order flow)
- Made it too easy to trade emotionally

Commission-free is great, but professional traders still use professional platforms (Thinkorswim, TradeStation, Interactive Brokers) for a reason.

### Andrew's Personal Story: The Trader-Explorer Lifestyle

Andrew's background is crucial context for understanding his approach:

**The Volcanic Seven Summits Challenge:**
- Climbing the highest volcano on each continent
- Mount Giluwe, Papua New Guinea (14,327 ft) - trading from remote hills
- Laptop and portable screens always nearby
- Forced to stay home during pandemic (like everyone else)

**What This Tells Us:**

1. **Trading is location-independent**: With internet, you can trade from anywhere
2. **Trading should enable life, not consume it**: Andrew uses trading income to fund adventures
3. **Discipline travels**: If you can trade successfully from a volcano, you have true discipline
4. **Balance is possible**: Not all traders sit in dark rooms staring at 6 monitors 16 hours/day

**The Pandemic Effect on Andrew:**
- Forced to stay home (borders closed)
- More free time than usual
- Already working on other books
- Used downtime to update "How to Day Trade for a Living"
- Addressed the surge in novice trader inquiries

**The Lesson:**

Successful traders often have rich lives outside of trading. The stereotype of the obsessed trader who does nothing else is often a failing trader compensating with overwork. The best traders I know:
- Have hobbies and passions outside markets
- Travel or spend time with family
- Treat trading as a profession with boundaries
- Don't trade every day (quality over quantity)

If you're entering trading thinking you'll sit in front of charts 12 hours a day, 7 days a week, you're setting yourself up for burnout and failure.

### Record-Keeping: The Doctor Analogy

Andrew makes a brilliant comparison between traders and doctors:

**"How many doctors or surgeons do you know who memorize the names of all of their patients, their prescribed medications, their medical history, and a summary of each appointment they've ever had? None. They all have excellent record-keeping tools."**

**Why This Matters:**

Trading without a journal is like being a doctor without patient records. You're relying on memory, which is:
- **Unreliable**: You'll remember big wins and forget small losses (selection bias)
- **Emotional**: You'll misremember why you took trades
- **Not data-driven**: Can't identify patterns without records
- **Not improvable**: Can't fix what you don't measure

**What Successful Traders Track:**

1. **Every trade**:
   - Date/time
   - Ticker symbol
   - Entry price and size
   - Exit price and P&L
   - Strategy used
   - Why you entered (setup criteria)
   - Why you exited (plan or emotion?)
   - Mistakes made
   - Lessons learned

2. **Daily summaries**:
   - Total P&L
   - Number of trades
   - Biggest winner/loser
   - Emotional state
   - Market conditions
   - What went well/poorly

3. **Weekly/monthly reviews**:
   - Win rate by strategy
   - Profit factor
   - Best time of day
   - Most profitable setups
   - Worst mistakes repeated
   - Progress toward goals

**Modern Tools Andrew Mentions:**

He moved from blogging trades to "online tools for journaling." This likely means:
- **TraderVue**: Popular journaling platform with analytics
- **Edgewonk**: Comprehensive trading journal with statistics
- **TradesViz**: Visual trade analysis and journaling
- **Excel/Google Sheets**: DIY custom tracking
- **TradingView's journal feature**: Built-in to charting platform

**2025 Update:**

Many platforms now offer built-in journaling. But the key isn't the tool—it's the **discipline to use it consistently.**

Beginner mistake: Spending 2 weeks researching the "perfect" journaling system, then using it for 3 days before quitting.

Professional approach: Pick any decent tool, commit to using it for 90 days minimum, analyze monthly.

### Student Success Stories Coming

Andrew mentions: **"In the last five years, I have mentored many new traders who have become successful. As a way to encourage novice traders, I felt it was important to reach out to some of my students and share their success stories in this new edition."**

**Why This Is Valuable:**

Most trading books only show the author's success. But the author might be:
- Exceptionally talented (not replicable)
- Lucky in their era (strategies don't work anymore)
- Not actually profitable (selling courses, not trading)

**Student success stories prove**:
- The methods are teachable
- Different personalities can succeed with adaptation
- The timeline to profitability for normal people
- Common obstacles and how they were overcome

**What to Look For in These Case Studies (Later in Book):**

- How long did it take to become profitable?
- How much capital did they lose before succeeding?
- What was their "low point" (Chapter 9 mentions this)
- What changed between failure and success?
- What strategies do they actually use?
- How did community/mentorship help?

These will be in Chapter 9 ("Case Study of a Newly Successful Trader"). Keep reading with the understanding that Andrew is setting up realistic success paths, not just his own exceptional journey.

### The Book's Philosophy: Short and Practical

Andrew explicitly states:

**"This book is deliberately short so readers will actually finish reading it and not get bored halfway through and put it to one side."**

**Why This Approach Works:**

1. **Completion rate matters**: A 200-page book you finish beats a 600-page book you abandon at page 150
2. **Modern attention spans**: Social media has shortened our focus—work with it, not against it
3. **Action over theory**: Better to learn 5 strategies well than know 50 strategies superficially
4. **Reduces overwhelm**: Trading is already overwhelming; a 600-page tome makes it worse

**The Distractions He Lists:**
- Emails
- Facebook
- Snapchat
- Instagram
- TikTok
- "Dozens of other apps"

**The Irony:**

These are the same distractions that will kill your trading career if you don't manage them. Checking TikTok while in a trade, reading Twitter during market hours, getting news notifications that trigger emotional reactions—these are how traders self-sabotage.

**Professional Approach:**
- Phone on "Do Not Disturb" during trading hours
- Social media blocked during market hours
- Email checked only pre-market and post-market
- News notifications turned off

If you can't disconnect for 2-3 hours to trade with full focus, you're not ready to risk real capital.

### Target Audience: Who This Book Is For

Andrew identifies three types of readers:

**1. "Recently begun trading"**
- You've opened an account, maybe made a few trades
- You're realizing it's harder than it looks
- You need structure and education

**2. "Someone interested in starting a career in trading"**
- Seriously considering this as a profession
- Want to understand requirements and realistic path
- Need honest assessment of difficulty

**3. "Sheltering in place under a stay-at-home order with time and an inquiring mind"**
- The 2020-specific audience
- Curious about markets due to news coverage
- Has time to learn something new

**What the Book Promises:**

- Where to start
- How to start
- What to expect from day trading
- How to develop your own strategy

**What It Doesn't Promise:**

Notice Andrew doesn't promise:
- "Make $10,000 per month in 90 days!"
- "Quit your job and trade full-time!"
- "Secret strategies the pros don't want you to know!"

This honesty is refreshing and indicates legitimate education, not marketing hype.

## How to Apply This in Real Trading

### Immediate Actions

1. **Assess your motivation honestly**
   - Did you become interested because of a market crash or news coverage?
   - Or have you been fascinated by markets for years?
   - Neither is wrong, but crisis-driven motivation needs extra caution

2. **Set realistic timeline expectations**
   - If starting during high volatility (2025 could still be volatile): Add 6 months to expected learning curve
   - Bull market learning: 12-18 months to profitability
   - Bear market learning: 18-24 months to profitability
   - Your mileage will vary, but don't expect 3-month success

3. **Choose your journaling system TODAY**
   - Don't spend weeks researching—pick one and start:
     - **Free**: Google Sheets or Excel template
     - **Paid**: TraderVue ($49/month), Edgewonk ($89 one-time)
   - Commit to 90 days minimum before evaluating effectiveness

4. **Research SPY and market indicators**
   - Open a free TradingView account
   - Add SPY to your watchlist
   - Watch how SPY direction affects individual stocks
   - Before trading any stock, check: "Is SPY bullish or bearish right now?"

5. **Eliminate trading-time distractions**
   - Set phone to "Do Not Disturb" mode during market hours
   - Close email, social media, news sites
   - Create a dedicated trading workspace if possible
   - Tell family/roommates not to interrupt during trading hours

### Integration with Previous Lessons

**Connecting to Part 1 (Disclaimer):**
- The "very high risk" warning is amplified during volatile periods like 2020
- Starting during a crisis increases risk—most who started in March 2020 likely failed

**Connecting to Part 2 (Table of Contents):**
- The structure (risk management before strategies) makes even more sense now
- Chapter 9 (Case Study) will show real trader journeys from failure to success
- The book's brevity aligns with modern attention spans Andrew mentions

**Connecting to Part 3 (Foreword - Community):**
- Andrew's mentorship of successful traders validates Bellafiore's community emphasis
- The student success stories will demonstrate "no one becomes a great trader alone"
- Record-keeping is part of the professional approach SMB Capital teaches

**New Understanding:**
- Andrew is not just a theorist—he trades actively from anywhere in the world
- The 2020 revision shows responsiveness to current conditions (good educator)
- His acknowledgment of distractions and short book format shows he understands modern learners
- The comparison to doctors and record-keeping elevates trading to a professional discipline

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Starting with real money during a crisis**
   - If you're reading this during high volatility (market crashes, meme stock crazes, etc.)
   - DO NOT start with real money immediately
   - Paper trade for MINIMUM 3 months before going live
   - Even then, start with tiny size ($100-500 risk per trade max)

2. **Chasing the excitement**
   - Crisis periods create FOMO (fear of missing out)
   - Seeing others make $10,000 on GameStop or crypto
   - Trying to replicate lottery-ticket wins
   - This is gambling, not trading—and it will destroy you

3. **Ignoring journaling from the start**
   - "I'll start tracking trades once I'm profitable"
   - WRONG—you need data to BECOME profitable
   - Starting without a journal is like driving blindfolded

4. **Broker paralysis**
   - Spending 2 months researching brokers
   - Analysis paralysis—can't choose because overwhelmed
   - Meanwhile, not actually learning to trade
   - Pick a decent one (Thinkorswim, TradeStation, Interactive Brokers) and move forward

5. **24/7 trading obsession**
   - Thinking you need to trade every day, all day
   - Watching charts from 9:30 AM to 4:00 PM and then pre-market and after-hours
   - Burning out within 3 months
   - Better approach: Trade first 2 hours (9:30-11:30 AM), then close laptop and live your life

6. **Commission-free false economy**
   - Choosing Robinhood because it's "free"
   - Overtrading because commissions don't hurt
   - Missing professional tools (Level 2, hotkeys, advanced orders)
   - Death by a thousand cuts from poor executions

## Senior Trader's Perspective

### What Actually Works in Live Markets

After 15+ years, here's my assessment of Andrew's Chapter 1 insights:

**The Crisis Interest Pattern Is 100% Real:**

I saw this personally in:
- **2008**: Flood of new traders who thought they could "catch the bottom"—99% gone within a year
- **2020**: Even bigger flood due to Robinhood, stimulus checks, and lockdowns—probably 95%+ gone
- **2021 Meme Stocks**: GameStop/AMC mania brought millions of new "traders" (gamblers)—most destroyed

**The pattern**: Crisis → Hype → Influx → Massacre

Those who survive are either:
1. Lucky (they'll lose it next time)
2. Exceptionally talented (outliers)
3. Humble enough to treat 2020 as tuition, not opportunity (they paper traded or used tiny size)

**If You Started During a Crisis:**

You're statistically behind, but not doomed. I know traders who started in 2008 and are now profitable. They all share these traits:
- Treated first year as education, not income generation
- Used tiny size or simulation for 6-12 months
- Ignored the hype and focused on process
- Found mentors or communities
- Journaled obsessively

**The SPY Lesson Is Critical:**

Andrew introduces SPY casually, but this is **the most important ticker symbol for day traders.**

Every morning before I trade, I check:
- Is SPY trending up, down, or sideways?
- What's the VIX (volatility)? High VIX = bigger moves but more risk
- Are we at support or resistance on the daily chart?
- What's the overall market bias?

**Why this matters**:
- If SPY is dumping -2%, going long most stocks is fighting the tide
- If SPY is ripping +1.5%, shorting is dangerous
- Most stocks correlate 70-90% with SPY direction

Beginners ignore SPY and wonder why their perfect setup on XYZ stock failed. Answer: SPY was bleeding red and taking everything down with it.

**Record-Keeping Separates Pros from Amateurs:**

The doctor analogy is perfect. In 15 years, I've NEVER met a consistently profitable trader who doesn't journal. Not one.

The traders who fail:
- "I'll remember the important stuff"
- "I don't have time to journal"
- "Journaling is for beginners"

The traders who succeed:
- Journal every single trade
- Review weekly
- Adjust based on data
- Treat it like a professional requirement

**My Personal Approach:**
- Real-time: Quick notes during the day (entry, exit, why)
- End of day: 15-minute review adding details and emotions
- Sunday: 1-hour weekly review analyzing patterns
- Monthly: 2-hour deep dive with statistics and adjustments

This isn't optional. If you skip journaling, you're gambling, not trading professionally.

### Modern Context (2025)

This chapter was written in mid-2020, during the pandemic. How does it hold up 5 years later?

**What's More Relevant Now (2025):**

1. **The crisis interest pattern has repeated**
   - 2021: GameStop/AMC meme stock mania brought millions of new "traders"
   - 2021: Crypto bubble attracted even more (most destroyed in 2022 crash)
   - 2022: Bear market scared away the tourists
   - 2023-2024: AI stock boom created new hype cycle
   - Each cycle: New cohort enters at wrong time for wrong reasons

2. **Commission-free is now universal**
   - All major brokers (Schwab, Fidelity, E-Trade) went commission-free
   - Robinhood's innovation became industry standard
   - But Robinhood's execution quality issues persist
   - Professional traders still pay for better platforms/execution

3. **Remote trading is even more normalized**
   - Andrew's "trader-explorer" lifestyle was unusual in 2015
   - Now post-pandemic, it's common
   - Digital nomad traders are everywhere
   - But connectivity and discipline challenges remain

4. **Attention spans are worse**
   - TikTok wasn't a major force in 2015 (launched 2016)
   - Now it's dominant, and videos are <60 seconds
   - Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts—everything is bite-sized
   - This makes focused trading even harder

5. **Journaling tools have improved**
   - TraderSync, TraderVue, Edgewonk all matured
   - Many brokers added built-in journals
   - AI-powered analysis is emerging
   - But most traders still don't use them

**What's Changed Since 2020:**

1. **Bear Bull Traders is larger**
   - Probably 10,000+ members now (vs. 5,000 in 2020)
   - More resources, more community structure
   - Pricing may have changed (verify current rates)

2. **SPY options (0DTE) exploded**
   - Zero days to expiration options are now huge
   - Massive volatility in SPY intraday
   - New opportunities and new risks
   - Beginners should avoid until very experienced

3. **Robinhood controversies**
   - GameStop "buy button" removal (Jan 2021)
   - Massive criticism and lawsuits
   - Users spread to Webull, Moomoo, traditional brokers
   - But Robinhood still has 10M+ active users

4. **Market structure changes**
   - Crypto trading 24/7 created new dynamics
   - Meme stock volatility changed risk models
   - Retail traders have more influence than ever
   - But algorithms still dominate (60-70% of volume)

**What to Update in Your Mind:**

When Andrew asks "What about Robinhood?", his 2020 answer may need 2025 context:

**Robinhood in 2025:**
- **Pros**: Free, simple, good for learning with tiny size
- **Cons**: Execution quality, limited tools, ethical controversies
- **Verdict**: OK for paper trading or accounts under $5K; upgrade to professional platform when serious

**Better options for 2025 day traders:**
- **Thinkorswim** (Charles Schwab): Best overall for education and simulation
- **TradeStation**: Best for active day traders with experience
- **Interactive Brokers**: Best for international or low-fee traders
- **Webull**: Decent middle ground with free Level 2

### Pro Tips & Advanced Insights

**Use Andrew's Timeline to Calibrate Expectations:**

He started this book in 2015 (9 years ago as of 2024). He mentions:
- "In the last five years, I have mentored many new traders who have become successful"
- This means they started around 2015-2016 and were successful by 2020 (roughly 4-5 years)

**What this tells you**: Even with mentorship from Andrew directly, it took 4-5 years for "many" to become successful. Not all. Not in 6 months. Many in 4-5 years.

If professionals with mentorship take that long, what's realistic for you?
- **With community/mentor**: 2-3 years to consistent profitability
- **Solo**: 3-5 years to consistent profitability (if you make it at all)
- **No education, just winging it**: 95%+ chance of failure

**The "Boring Markets" Secret:**

Professional traders actually prefer boring, low-volatility markets. Volatile markets attract attention, but they're HARDER to trade profitably.

**Boring bull market characteristics:**
- Predictable patterns repeat
- Support/resistance holds reliably
- Emotions are manageable
- Consistency is easier

**Exciting volatile market characteristics:**
- Patterns fail frequently
- Support/resistance blown through
- Emotions run wild
- Consistency nearly impossible

**If you're starting in 2025** and markets are relatively calm, consider it a gift. Don't wish for volatility—use the calm period to build skills.

**SPY Trading Journal Hack:**

In every journal entry, include:
- **SPY direction at entry**: Bullish, bearish, or choppy?
- **Your trade direction**: Long or short?
- **Alignment**: Were you with SPY or against it?

After 100 trades, analyze:
- Win rate when aligned with SPY: __%
- Win rate when against SPY: __%

You'll likely find you win 60-70% aligned, 30-40% against. This data tells you to **only trade with SPY, never against it.**

**The Lifestyle Design Question:**

Andrew trades from volcanoes. You probably won't. But ask yourself:

**"What lifestyle am I designing?"**
- Do you want to trade 8 hours a day and make maximum income?
- Or trade 2 hours a day and have time for hobbies?
- Do you want to travel while trading?
- Or stay in one location with setup and routine?

There's no wrong answer, but the wrong answer is "I'll figure it out later." Design your desired lifestyle now, then build trading around it.

**Example**:
- If you want to travel, you need strategies that work in first 2 hours (9:30-11:30 AM EST) so you can explore afternoons
- If you want maximum income, you might trade all sessions (pre-market, regular hours, after-hours)
- If you have a day job, you're limited to pre-market (7-9:30 AM) or after-hours (4-8 PM)

Design the life, then build the trading business to support it.

**The Distraction Elimination System:**

Andrew lists social media distractions. Here's how professionals handle it:

**Option 1: Extreme (Most Effective)**
- Delete trading apps during trading hours
- Use website blockers (Freedom, Cold Turkey)
- Literally impossible to access during 9:30-11:30 AM

**Option 2: Moderate (Requires Discipline)**
- Phone on Do Not Disturb
- Apps in folder on last screen
- Check only during scheduled breaks

**Option 3: Soft (Least Effective)**
- "I'll just use willpower"
- Spoiler: You won't. No one has that much willpower.

I recommend Option 1 for first 6 months of trading. Once you've built the focus habit, you can relax to Option 2.

### Personal Opinion

**What's Excellent:**

1. **Honesty about why he revised the book**: Most authors would hide the market crash context or spin it positively. Andrew acknowledges the crisis brought new traders for wrong reasons.

2. **The Google Trends data**: Showing the correlation between crashes and interest is brilliant. This alone should make crisis-motivated traders pause and recalibrate.

3. **Record-keeping emphasis**: Comparing traders to doctors is one of the best analogies I've seen. It elevates trading from "I'm gonna get rich!" to "I'm learning a profession."

4. **Lifestyle context**: Sharing his climbing adventures humanizes him and shows trading can fund a life, not consume it.

5. **"Deliberately short" philosophy**: Respecting readers' time and attention spans. Too many trading books are 600 pages of filler.

6. **Student success stories promise**: Not just showing his own success, but proving the methods work for others.

**What Needs Adjustment:**

1. **Robinhood discussion may be outdated**: By 2025, Robinhood has had major controversies (GameStop buy button). Andrew's 2020 take may need updating.

2. **Missing the "post-crisis failure rate" discussion**: Andrew should explicitly state that most traders who start during crises fail. He hints at it but doesn't emphasize enough.

3. **The SPY introduction is too casual**: This is the most important ticker for day traders, and it's mentioned almost as an aside. Needs more emphasis.

**What's Timeless:**

- Crisis-driven interest pattern (true in every crash since 1929)
- Need for record-keeping (true in all professions)
- Importance of reducing distractions (true for all focused work)
- Learning curve is long (true throughout trading history)

**My Recommendation:**

This chapter is deceptively important. It looks like "background information," but it contains critical lessons:

1. **If crisis brought you here, acknowledge it and adjust expectations**
2. **SPY is king—watch it before trading anything**
3. **Journaling isn't optional—start today**
4. **The book is short by design—actually finish it**
5. **Success takes years, not months**

Many readers will skim this chapter to "get to the strategies." Don't. The mindset and context established here determine whether you'll still be trading in 5 years.

## Key Takeaways (TL;DR)

1. **Market crashes attract new traders for the wrong reasons** - Google Trends show interest spikes during crises, but starting in maximum volatility with minimum experience is a recipe for failure

2. **SPY is the most important ticker for day traders** - Watch S&P 500 direction before trading any stock; most stocks correlate 70-90% with SPY movement

3. **Record-keeping is professional requirement, not optional** - Like doctors with patient records, successful traders journal every trade and review data systematically

4. **The book is deliberately short and practical** - Designed for completion despite modern distractions (social media, email, apps)

5. **Trading should enable lifestyle, not consume it** - Andrew trades from anywhere (even volcanoes), showing trading can fund life's adventures

6. **Student success stories coming prove methods are teachable** - Not just Andrew's success, but mentees who went from failure to profitability

7. **Timeline for success is years, not months** - Andrew's students took 4-5 years to become successful; calibrate your expectations accordingly

## Glossary

**Bull Market**: Extended period (months to years) of rising stock prices, characterized by investor optimism and "buy the dip" mentality. The 2009-2020 bull market was the longest in history (11 years).

**Bear Market**: Extended period of falling stock prices, typically defined as a decline of 20% or more from recent highs. Characterized by pessimism and fear. The March 2020 crash created the first bear market many traders had experienced.

**SPY (SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust)**: Exchange-traded fund tracking the S&P 500 index (500 largest US companies). The most liquid ETF in the world and the most important ticker for day traders to watch. When SPY is green, most stocks trend up; when red, most trend down.

**S&P 500**: Stock market index tracking 500 of the largest publicly traded US companies. Widely regarded as the best gauge of the overall US stock market performance.

**Google Trends**: Google's tool showing search volume for keywords over time. In the chapter, Andrew uses it to show correlation between market crashes and increased "stock market" searches.

**Circuit Breaker**: Trading halt mechanism that pauses trading when markets decline too rapidly. Triggered multiple times during March 2020 crash. Three levels: 7%, 13%, and 20% declines from previous close.

**VIX (Volatility Index)**: Measure of expected market volatility, often called the "fear gauge." High VIX = high volatility and uncertainty. March 2020 saw VIX hit all-time highs.

**Robinhood**: Commission-free trading app launched in 2013 that popularized zero-commission stock trading. Known for simple interface and mobile-first design. Controversial for gamification of trading and execution quality issues.

**Commission-Free Trading**: Brokerage model charging $0 per trade (vs. traditional $5-10 per trade). Became industry standard after Robinhood's success, with all major brokers eliminating commissions by 2019.

**Dot-Com Bubble (2000)**: Stock market bubble in late 1990s when internet company valuations soared to absurd levels, then crashed in 2000-2002. Many new day traders entered during the bubble and lost everything.

**2008 Financial Crisis**: Global economic crisis triggered by US housing bubble collapse and subprime mortgage crisis. Stock market declined 50%+ from peak. Many banks failed or were bailed out.

**COVID-19 Pandemic (2020)**: Global pandemic causing economic shutdown, market crash (fastest in history, 35% decline in weeks), and unprecedented government stimulus. Created surge in new retail traders.

**Day Trading**: Buying and selling securities within the same trading day, closing all positions before market close. No overnight risk, but requires active management and quick decision-making.

**Journaling (Trading)**: Systematic record-keeping of every trade including entry/exit prices, strategy used, emotions, mistakes, and lessons. Essential for data-driven improvement and professional development.

**Paper Trading (Simulation)**: Practice trading with fake money in real market conditions. Allows skill development without financial risk. Recommended for 3-6 months before risking real capital.

**Volatility**: Degree of price fluctuation. High volatility = large, rapid price swings (exciting but risky). Low volatility = small, slow movements (boring but easier to trade consistently).

**Gapping (Gap Up/Down)**: When a stock opens significantly higher or lower than previous close, creating a visible "gap" on the chart. Common after earnings reports or major news.

**Position Size**: Number of shares traded. Proper position sizing based on account size and stop distance is critical for risk management. Beginners often size too large.

**Volcanic Seven Summits**: Mountaineering challenge to climb the highest volcano on each continent. Andrew Aziz's personal goal, demonstrating trading can fund adventure lifestyle.

**TraderVue / Edgewonk**: Popular trading journal software platforms offering analytics, statistics, and trade review features. Help traders identify patterns and improve systematically.

**Level 2 Data**: Real-time view of bid/ask prices and order book depth. Shows where buyers and sellers are positioned. Essential for day trading, available free on some platforms (Webull) or paid on others.
